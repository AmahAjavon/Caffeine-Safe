# Caffeine Safe 

This application helps a coffee lover maintain his/her caffeine intake on a safe level. The users can choose their favorite caffeine drink and enter the amount they consumed. The app will tell them how many more they can have to stay on the safe level.
Web app built with `React`, `Redux` on the client side, and  `Node` on the server side. I'm using `Sequelize` for `mysql` database. In this application, I also implemented a user Login and Registration with `jsonwebtoken`, `bcrypt` and an API calls.
